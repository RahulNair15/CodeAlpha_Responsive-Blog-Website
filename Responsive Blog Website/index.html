            <span class="post-date">12 July 2023</span>
            <p class="post-description">As creators or developers, we all have a billion-dollar idea that requires a billion-dollar app to solve users’ problems. But how do you test and validate your app idea using design? With Figma, this is possible because you can design, prototype, and collaborate on your design with your potential uses.
               In this tutorial, you’ll work on an app where users can order groceries and have them delivered within 10 minutes at their location. Normally, before designing an app like this, you’d need to do user research and a market survey. This is the user experience (UX) design side of building a business idea. Then, after the research, you’d design the app based on the research result you have. This aspect is the user interface (UI) design. In this post, we’ll focus on the UI side of things by designing the app home screen.</p>

As an active or aspiring engineer, you almost certainly have encountered the term at least once, if not daily. DevOps (and other similar titles in its orbit such as Platform Engineer, SRE, and Cloud Engineer) see a lot of hype and a lot of debate. Which one is best? What skills and tools are important to study? Do skills and tools even matter anymore? In this article, we’ll discuss the modern DevOps landscape, and how you can build your skillset to become a DevOps engineer yourself.</p>

            <p class="post-description">
                Understandably, there’s a lot of excitement about Tesla opening discussions with GOI for setting up a factory in the country with an annual capacity of 5 lakh electric vehicles – at a relatively lower price band. Should the project happen, it will change the profile of local EV manufacturing and exports from India. Note that Tesla has a significant presence in China. But as Western manufacturers look to de-risk from Beijing, India is one of the options. New Delhi should grab the opportunities coming its way.</p>

            <p class="post-description">Whatever the political class may think of the unending musical chairs in Maharashtra, the popular reaction to netas changing sides at periodic intervals isn’t likely to be positive. Had these shifts been preceded by events of significance, a review of existing alignments may have been understandable. However, since the then Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray broke away from the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in November 2019, violated the spirit of the electoral verdict and joined hands with the Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) to become chief minister, political allegiances have become negotiable for reasons that are grounded entirely on personal ambitions.</p>

                <p>Just over a year ago, we became fascinated by the idea of discovering the world through someone else's eyes. What if you could see through the eyes of a protester in Ukraine? Or watch the sunrise from a hot air balloon in Cappadocia? It may sound crazy, but we wanted to build the closest thing to teleportation. While there are many ways to discover events and places, we realized there is no better way to experience a place right now than through blogs. A information may be worth a thousand words, but blog can take you someplace and show you around.</p>
